P01137	390	Transforming growth factor beta-1 proprotein	?	TGFB1	Homo sapiens	Human	Transforming growth factor beta-1 proprotein: Precursor of the Latency-associated peptide (LAP) and Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta-1) chains, which constitute the regulatory and active subunit of TGF-beta-1, respectively. Latency-associated peptide: Required to maintain the Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta-1) chain in a latent state during storage in extracellular matrix (PubMed:28117447). Associates non-covalently with TGF-beta-1 and regulates its activation via interaction with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1, LRRC32/GARP and LRRC33/NRROS, that control activation of TGF-beta-1 (PubMed:2022183, PubMed:8617200, PubMed:8939931, PubMed:19750484, PubMed:22278742, PubMed:19651619). Interaction with LRRC33/NRROS regulates activation of TGF-beta-1 in macrophages and microglia (Probable). Interaction with LRRC32/GARP controls activation of TGF-beta-1 on the surface of activated regulatory T-cells (Tregs) (PubMed:19750484, PubMed:22278742, PubMed:19651619). Interaction with integrins (ITGAV:ITGB6 or ITGAV:ITGB8) results in distortion of the Latency-associated peptide chain and subsequent release of the active TGF-beta-1 (PubMed:22278742, PubMed:28117447). Transforming growth factor beta-1: Multifunctional protein that regulates the growth and differentiation of various cell types and is involved in various processes, such as normal development, immune function, microglia function and responses to neurodegeneration (By similarity). Activation into mature form follows different steps: following cleavage of the proprotein in the Golgi apparatus, Latency-associated peptide (LAP) and Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta-1) chains remain non-covalently linked rendering TGF-beta-1 inactive during storage in extracellular matrix (PubMed:29109152). At the same time, LAP chain interacts with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1, LRRC32/GARP and LRRC33/NRROS that control activation of TGF-beta-1 and maintain it in a latent state during storage in extracellular milieus (PubMed:2022183, PubMed:8617200, PubMed:8939931, PubMed:19750484, PubMed:22278742, PubMed:19651619). TGF-beta-1 is released from LAP by integrins (ITGAV:ITGB6 or ITGAV:ITGB8): integrin-binding to LAP stabilizes an alternative conformation of the LAP bowtie tail and results in distortion of the LAP chain and subsequent release of the active TGF-beta-1 (PubMed:22278742, PubMed:28117447). Once activated following release of LAP, TGF-beta-1 acts by binding to TGF-beta receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), which transduce signal (PubMed:20207738). While expressed by many cells types, TGF-beta-1 only has a very localized range of action within cell environment thanks to fine regulation of its activation by Latency-associated peptide chain (LAP) and 'milieu molecules' (By similarity). Plays an important role in bone remodeling: acts as a potent stimulator of osteoblastic bone formation, causing chemotaxis, proliferation and differentiation in committed osteoblasts (By similarity). Can promote either T-helper 17 cells (Th17) or regulatory T-cells (Treg) lineage differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner (By similarity). At high concentrations, leads to FOXP3-mediated suppression of RORC and down-regulation of IL-17 expression, favoring Treg cell development (By similarity). At low concentrations in concert with IL-6 and IL-21, leads to expression of the IL-17 and IL-23 receptors, favoring differentiation to Th17 cells (By similarity). Stimulates sustained production of collagen through the activation of CREB3L1 by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) (PubMed:25310401). Mediates SMAD2/3 activation by inducing its phosphorylation and subsequent translocation to the nucleus (PubMed:25893292, PubMed:29483653, PubMed:30696809). Can induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration in various cell types (PubMed:25893292, PubMed:30696809).

Has a major function in hemostasis as one of the primary components of blood clots. In addition, functions during the early stages of wound repair to stabilize the lesion and guide cell migration during re-epithelialization. Was originally thought to be essential for platelet aggregation, based on in vitro studies using anticoagulated blood. However, subsequent studies have shown that it is not absolutely required for thrombus formation in vivo. Enhances expression of SELP in activated platelets via an ITGB3-dependent pathway. Maternal fibrinogen is essential for successful pregnancy. Fibrin deposition is also associated with infection, where it protects against IFNG-mediated hemorrhage.

P03308	2333	Genome polyprotein	?	?	Foot-and-mouth disease virus (isolate Bovine/United Kingdom/A12Valle119/1932 serotype A)	FMDV	Leader protease: Autocatalytically cleaves itself from the polyprotein at the L/VP0 junction. Cleaves also the host translation initiation factors EIF4G1 and EIF4G3, in order to shutoff the capped cellular mRNA transcription. Plays a role in counteracting host innate antiviral response using diverse mechanisms. Possesses a deubiquitinase activity acting on both 'Lys'-48 and 'Lys'-63-linked polyubiquitin chains. In turn, inhibits the ubiquitination and subsequent activation of key signaling molecules of type I IFN response such as host DDX58, TBK1, TRAF3 and TRAF6. Inhibits host NF-kappa-B activity by inducing a decrease in RELA mRNA levels. Cleaves a peptide bond in the C-terminus of host ISG15, resulting in the damaging of this mofidier that can no longer be attached to target proteins. Cleaves also host G3BP1 and G3BP2 in order to inhibit cytoplasmic stress granules assembly (PubMed:30404792). Capsid protein VP4: Lies on the inner surface of the capsid shell. After binding to the host receptor, the capsid undergoes conformational changes. Capsid protein VP4 is released, capsid protein VP1 N-terminus is externalized, and together, they shape a pore in the host membrane through which the viral genome is translocated into the host cell cytoplasm. After genome has been released, the channel shrinks. Capsid protein VP2: Forms an icosahedral capsid of pseudo T=3 symmetry with capsid proteins VP1 and VP3. The capsid is composed of 60 copies of each capsid protein organized in the form of twelve pentamers and encloses the viral positive strand RNA genome.

The capsid is composed of 60 copies of each capsid protein organized in the form of twelve pentamers and encloses the viral positive strand RNA genome. Protein 2A: Mediates self-processing of the polyprotein by a translational effect termed 'ribosome skipping'. Mechanistically, 2A-mediated cleavage occurs between the C-terminal glycine and the proline of the downstream protein 2B. In the case of foot-and-mouth disease virus, the 2A oligopeptide is post-translationally 'trimmed' from the C-terminus of the upstream protein 1D by 3C proteinase. Protein 2B: Plays an essential role in the virus replication cycle by acting as a viroporin. Creates a pore in the host reticulum endoplasmic and as a consequence releases Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of infected cell. In turn, high levels of cytoplasmic calcium may trigger membrane trafficking and transport of viral ER-associated proteins to viroplasms, sites of viral genome replication. Protein 2C: Associates with and induces structural rearrangements of intracellular membranes. Triggers host autophagy by interacting with host BECN1 and thereby promotes viral replication.

RNA-directed RNA polymerase 3D-POL replicates genomic and antigenomic RNA by recognizing replications specific signals. Covalently attaches UMP to a tyrosine of VPg, which is used to prime RNA synthesis. The positive stranded RNA genome is first replicated at virus induced membranous vesicles, creating a dsRNA genomic replication form. This dsRNA is then used as template to synthesize positive stranded RNA genomes. ss(+)RNA genomes are either translated, replicated or encapsidated.

A recombinant protein of this domain (409-484) inhibits collagen-induced human platelet aggregation, without having effect on ADP-induced aggregation. It may act either by blocking the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet receptor GPIIb/GPIIIa (ITGA2B/ITGB3) or by blocking the binding of collagen to the integrin alpha-2/beta-1 complex (ITGA2/ITGB1).

Also binds the alpha-4/beta-1 (ITGA4/ITGB1) integrin. Is a potent inhibitor of human and murine melanoma metastases in mouse model systems, also due to the inhibition of binding between the alpha-4/beta-1 integrin and the vascular cell adhesion protein VCAM1. Reacts neither with the integrin alpha-V/beta-3 (ITGAV/ITGB3) vitronectin receptor nor with the integrin alpha-5/beta-1 (ITGA5/ITGB1) fibronectin receptor. Has no effect on cell proliferation or angiogenesis. Specifically inhibits cell migration on fibronectin, but not that on collagen IV or laminin. May involve fibronectin-binding integrins that mediate cell migration.
P0C7X7	73	Disintegrin mojastin-2	?	?	Crotalus scutulatus scutulatus	Mojave rattlesnake	Disintegrin mojastin-1: Inhibits the three processes involved in platelet function (adhesion, activation and aggregation). It inhibits platelet adhesion to fibronectin with an IC(50) of 58.6 nM. It inhibits ATP release from platelet induced by ADP with an IC(50) of 19.5 nM on platelet-rich plasma, probably by binding to ADP receptors (P2RY1 and P2RY12). Finally, it inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation with IC(50) of 44.7 nM on platelet-rich plasma and 19.3 nM on whole blood, probably by binding to alpha-IIb/beta-3 (ITGA2B/ITGB3) (PubMed:20598348). Disintegrin mojastin-2: Inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation (IC(50) = 13.8 nM) probably by binding to alpha-IIb/beta-3 (ITGA2B/ITGB3) located on the platelet surface.

P10600	412	Transforming growth factor beta-3 proprotein	?	TGFB3	Homo sapiens	Human	Transforming growth factor beta-3 proprotein: Precursor of the Latency-associated peptide (LAP) and Transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGF-beta-3) chains, which constitute the regulatory and active subunit of TGF-beta-3, respectively. Latency-associated peptide: Required to maintain the Transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGF-beta-3) chain in a latent state during storage in extracellular matrix (By similarity). Associates non-covalently with TGF-beta-3 and regulates its activation via interaction with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1 and LRRC32/GARP, that control activation of TGF-beta-3 (By similarity). Interaction with integrins results in distortion of the Latency-associated peptide chain and subsequent release of the active TGF-beta-3 (By similarity). Transforming growth factor beta-3: Multifunctional protein that regulates embryogenesis and cell differentiation and is required in various processes such as secondary palate development (By similarity). Activation into mature form follows different steps: following cleavage of the proprotein in the Golgi apparatus, Latency-associated peptide (LAP) and Transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGF-beta-3) chains remain non-covalently linked rendering TGF-beta-3 inactive during storage in extracellular matrix (By similarity). At the same time, LAP chain interacts with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1 and LRRC32/GARP that control activation of TGF-beta-3 and maintain it in a latent state during storage in extracellular milieus (By similarity). TGF-beta-3 is released from LAP by integrins: integrin-binding results in distortion of the LAP chain and subsequent release of the active TGF-beta-3 (By similarity). Once activated following release of LAP, TGF-beta-3 acts by binding to TGF-beta receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), which transduce signal (By similarity).

Hydrolyzes the ester bond of the fatty acyl group attached at sn-2 position of phospholipids (phospholipase A2 activity) with preference for phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylglycerols over phosphatidylcholines (PubMed:10455175, PubMed:10681567). Contributes to lipid remodeling of cellular membranes and generation of lipid mediators involved in pathogen clearance. Displays bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria by directly hydrolyzing phospholipids of the bacterial membrane (PubMed:11694541, PubMed:10358193). Upon sterile inflammation, targets membrane phospholipids of extracellular mitochondria released from activated platelets, generating free unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonate that is used by neighboring leukocytes to synthesize inflammatory eicosanoids such as leukotrienes. Simultaneously, by compromising mitochondrial membrane integrity, promotes the release in circulation of potent damage-associated molecular pattern molecules that activate the innate immune response (PubMed:25082876). Plays a stem cell regulator role in the intestinal crypt. Within intracellular compartment mediates Paneth cell differentiation and its stem cell supporting functions by inhibiting Wnt signaling pathway in intestinal stem cell (ICS). Secreted in the intestinal lumen upon inflammation, acts in an autocrine way and promotes prostaglandin E2 synthesis that stimulates Wnt signaling pathway in ICS cells and tissue regeneration (By similarity). May play a role in the biosynthesis of N-acyl ethanolamines that regulate energy metabolism and inflammation. Hydrolyzes N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines to N-acyl lysophosphatidylethanolamines, which are further cleaved by a lysophospholipase D to release N-acyl ethanolamines (PubMed:14998370). Independent of its catalytic activity, acts as a ligand for integrins (PubMed:18635536, PubMed:25398877). Binds to and activates integrins ITGAV:ITGB3, ITGA4:ITGB1 and ITGA5:ITGB1 (PubMed:18635536, PubMed:25398877). Binds to a site (site 2) which is distinct from the classical ligand-binding site (site 1) and induces integrin conformational changes and enhanced ligand binding to site 1 (PubMed:25398877). Induces cell proliferation in an integrin-dependent manner (PubMed:18635536).

Competition with fibrinogen for the RGD recognition sites on the alpha-IIb/beta-3 integrin (glyco-protein IIb/IIIa complex) results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation and other antithrombotic properties such as an ability to prevent coronary thrombosis in animal models (PubMed:3198653, PubMed:2320569) (Probable). Is also a potent inhibitor of bone resorption. This results from the blocking of the interaction of alpha-V/beta-3 integrin on the surface of osteoclasts with bone extracellular matrix (Probable). In addition, interaction with alpha-V/beta-3 also inhibits human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) proliferation (IC(50)=103.2 nM) and inhibits the migration of some tumor cells (IC(50)=1.5-154.5 nM), suggesting that this disintegrin could be a good scaffold to design potent antiangiogenic agents by modifying its unique C-terminal tail structure (Probable) (PubMed:33182321).

P21404	2201	Genome polyprotein	?	?	Coxsackievirus A9 (strain Griggs)	?	Capsid protein VP1: Forms an icosahedral capsid of pseudo T=3 symmetry with capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 (By similarity). The capsid is 300 Angstroms in diameter, composed of 60 copies of each capsid protein and enclosing the viral positive strand RNA genome (By similarity). Capsid protein VP1 mainly forms the vertices of the capsid (By similarity). Capsid protein VP1 interacts with host integrin ITGAV/ITGB6 to provide virion attachment to target host cells (Probable). This attachment induces virion internalization (By similarity). Tyrosine kinases are probably involved in the entry process (By similarity). After binding to its receptor, the capsid undergoes conformational changes (By similarity). Capsid protein VP1 N-terminus (that contains an amphipathic alpha-helix) and capsid protein VP4 are externalized (By similarity). Together, they shape a pore in the host membrane through which viral genome is translocated to host cell cytoplasm (By similarity). Capsid protein VP2: Forms an icosahedral capsid of pseudo T=3 symmetry with capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 (By similarity). The capsid is 300 Angstroms in diameter, composed of 60 copies of each capsid protein and enclosing the viral positive strand RNA genome (By similarity). Capsid protein VP3: Forms an icosahedral capsid of pseudo T=3 symmetry with capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 (By similarity). The capsid is 300 Angstroms in diameter, composed of 60 copies of each capsid protein and enclosing the viral positive strand RNA genome (By similarity). Capsid protein VP4: Lies on the inner surface of the capsid shell (By similarity). After binding to the host receptor, the capsid undergoes conformational changes (By similarity). Capsid protein VP4 is released, Capsid protein VP1 N-terminus is externalized, and together, they shape a pore in the host membrane through which the viral genome is translocated into the host cell cytoplasm (By similarity). Capsid protein VP0: Component of immature procapsids, which is cleaved into capsid proteins VP4 and VP2 after maturation (By similarity). Allows the capsid to remain inactive before the maturation step (By similarity). Protease 2A: Cysteine protease that cleaves viral polyprotein and specific host proteins (By similarity). It is responsible for the autocatalytic cleavage between the P1 and P2 regions, which is the first cleavage occurring in the polyprotein (By similarity). Cleaves also the host translation initiation factor EIF4G1, in order to shut down the capped cellular mRNA translation (By similarity). Inhibits the host nucleus-cytoplasm protein and RNA trafficking by cleaving host members of the nuclear pores (By similarity). Counteracts stress granule formation probably by antagonizing its assembly or promoting its dissassembly (By similarity). Cleaves and inhibits host IFIH1/MDA5, thereby inhibiting the type-I IFN production and the establishment of the antiviral state (By similarity). Cleaves and inhibits host MAVS, thereby inhibiting the type-I IFN production and the establishment of the antiviral state (By similarity). Protein 2B: Plays an essential role in the virus replication cycle by acting as a viroporin. Creates a pore in the host reticulum endoplasmic and as a consequence releases Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of infected cell. In turn, high levels of cytoplasmic calcium may trigger membrane trafficking and transport of viral ER-associated proteins to viroplasms, sites of viral genome replication. Protein 2C: Induces and associates with structural rearrangements of intracellular membranes. Displays RNA-binding, nucleotide binding and NTPase activities. May play a role in virion morphogenesis and viral RNA encapsidation by interacting with the capsid protein VP3. Protein 3AB: Localizes the viral replication complex to the surface of membranous vesicles. Together with protein 3CD binds the Cis-Active RNA Element (CRE) which is involved in RNA synthesis initiation. Acts as a cofactor to stimulate the activity of 3D polymerase, maybe through a nucleid acid chaperone activity. Protein 3A: Localizes the viral replication complex to the surface of membranous vesicles (By similarity). It inhibits host cell endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi apparatus transport and causes the disassembly of the Golgi complex, possibly through GBF1 interaction (By similarity). This would result in depletion of MHC, trail receptors and IFN receptors at the host cell surface (By similarity). Plays an essential role in viral RNA replication by recruiting ACBD3 and PI4KB at the viral replication sites, thereby allowing the formation of the rearranged membranous structures where viral replication takes place (By similarity). Viral protein genome-linked: Acts as a primer for viral RNA replication and remains covalently bound to viral genomic RNA. VPg is uridylylated prior to priming replication into VPg-pUpU (By similarity). The oriI viral genomic sequence may act as a template for this. The VPg-pUpU is then used as primer on the genomic RNA poly(A) by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to replicate the viral genome (By similarity). Following genome release from the infecting virion in the cytoplasm, the VPg-RNA linkage is probably removed by host TDP2 (By similarity). During the late stage of the replication cycle, host TDP2 is excluded from sites of viral RNA synthesis and encapsidation, allowing for the generation of progeny virions (By similarity). Protein 3CD: Involved in the viral replication complex and viral polypeptide maturation. It exhibits protease activity with a specificity and catalytic efficiency that is different from protease 3C. Protein 3CD lacks polymerase activity. Protein 3CD binds to the 5'UTR of the viral genome. RNA-directed RNA polymerase: Replicates the viral genomic RNA on the surface of intracellular membranes. May form linear arrays of subunits that propagate along a strong head-to-tail interaction called interface-I. Covalently attaches UMP to a tyrosine of VPg, which is used to prime RNA synthesis. The positive stranded RNA genome is first replicated at virus induced membranous vesicles, creating a dsRNA genomic replication form. This dsRNA is then used as template to synthesize positive stranded RNA genomes. ss(+)RNA genomes are either translated, replicated or encapsidated. Protease 3C: Major viral protease that mediates proteolytic processing of the polyprotein (By similarity). Cleaves host EIF5B, contributing to host translation shutoff (By similarity). Cleaves also host PABPC1, contributing to host translation shutoff (By similarity). Cleaves host NLRP1, triggers host N-glycine-mediated degradation of the autoinhibitory NLRP1 N-terminal fragment (By similarity).

P35555	2871	Fibrillin-1	?	FBN1	Homo sapiens	Human	Fibrillin-1: Structural component of the 10-12 nm diameter microfibrils of the extracellular matrix, which conveys both structural and regulatory properties to load-bearing connective tissues (PubMed:1860873, PubMed:15062093). Fibrillin-1-containing microfibrils provide long-term force bearing structural support (PubMed:27026396). In tissues such as the lung, blood vessels and skin, microfibrils form the periphery of the elastic fiber, acting as a scaffold for the deposition of elastin (PubMed:27026396). In addition, microfibrils can occur as elastin-independent networks in tissues such as the ciliary zonule, tendon, cornea and glomerulus where they provide tensile strength and have anchoring roles (PubMed:27026396). Fibrillin-1 also plays a key role in tissue homeostasis through specific interactions with growth factors, such as the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) and latent transforming growth factor-beta-binding proteins (LTBPs), cell-surface integrins and other extracellular matrix protein and proteoglycan components (PubMed:27026396). Regulates osteoblast maturation by controlling TGF-beta bioavailability and calibrating TGF-beta and BMP levels, respectively (By similarity). Negatively regulates osteoclastogenesis by binding and sequestering an osteoclast differentiation and activation factor TNFSF11 (PubMed:24039232). This leads to disruption of TNFSF11-induced Ca(2+) signaling and impairment of TNFSF11-mediated nuclear translocation and activation of transcription factor NFATC1 which regulates genes important for osteoclast differentiation and function (PubMed:24039232). Mediates cell adhesion via its binding to cell surface receptors integrins ITGAV:ITGB3 and ITGA5:ITGB1 (PubMed:12807887, PubMed:17158881). Binds heparin and this interaction has an important role in the assembly of microfibrils (PubMed:11461921). Asprosin: Adipokine secreted by white adipose tissue that plays an important regulatory role in the glucose metabolism of liver, muscle and pancreas (PubMed:27087445, PubMed:30853600). Hormone that targets the liver in response to fasting to increase plasma glucose levels (PubMed:27087445). Binds the olfactory receptor OR4M1 at the surface of hepatocytes and promotes hepatocyte glucose release by activating the protein kinase A activity in the liver, resulting in rapid glucose release into the circulation (PubMed:27087445, PubMed:31230984). May act as a regulator of adaptive thermogenesis by inhibiting browning and energy consumption, while increasing lipid deposition in white adipose tissue (By similarity). Also acts as an orexigenic hormone that increases appetite: crosses the blood brain barrier and exerts effects on the hypothalamus (By similarity). In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, asprosin directly activates orexigenic AgRP neurons and indirectly inhibits anorexigenic POMC neurons, resulting in appetite stimulation (By similarity). Activates orexigenic AgRP neurons via binding to the olfactory receptor OR4M1 (By similarity). May also play a role in sperm motility in testis via interaction with OR4M1 receptor (By similarity).

Latency-associated peptide: Required to maintain the Transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF-beta-2) chain in a latent state during storage in extracellular matrix (By similarity). Associates non-covalently with TGF-beta-2 and regulates its activation via interaction with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1 and LRRC32/GARP, that control activation of TGF-beta-2 (By similarity). Transforming growth factor beta-2: Multifunctional protein that regulates various processes such as angiogenesis and heart development (PubMed:22772371, PubMed:22772368). Activation into mature form follows different steps: following cleavage of the proprotein in the Golgi apparatus, Latency-associated peptide (LAP) and Transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF-beta-2) chains remain non-covalently linked rendering TGF-beta-2 inactive during storage in extracellular matrix (By similarity). At the same time, LAP chain interacts with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1 and LRRC32/GARP, that control activation of TGF-beta-2 and maintain it in a latent state during storage in extracellular milieus (By similarity). Once activated following release of LAP, TGF-beta-2 acts by binding to TGF-beta receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), which transduce signal (By similarity).

The CX3CR1-CX3CL1 signaling exerts distinct functions in different tissue compartments, such as immune response, inflammation, cell adhesion and chemotaxis (PubMed:9024663, PubMed:9177350, PubMed:9782118, PubMed:12055230). Regulates leukocyte adhesion and migration processes at the endothelium (PubMed:9024663, PubMed:9177350). Can activate integrins in both a CX3CR1-dependent and CX3CR1-independent manner (PubMed:23125415, PubMed:24789099). In the presence of CX3CR1, activates integrins by binding to the classical ligand-binding site (site 1) in integrins (PubMed:23125415, PubMed:24789099). In the absence of CX3CR1, binds to a second site (site 2) in integrins which is distinct from site 1 and enhances the binding of other integrin ligands to site 1 (PubMed:23125415, PubMed:24789099).

Q66578	2180	Genome polyprotein	?	?	Human parechovirus 1 (strain Harris)	HPeV-1	Capsid proteins VP0, VP2, VP3 form a closed capsid enclosing the viral positive strand RNA genome. Capsid proteins interact with host alpha-V/beta-3 integrin heterodimer to provide virion attachment target cell. This attachment induces virion internalization predominantly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Protein 2A: Is not a protease. Protein 2B: Affects membrane integrity and cause an increase in membrane permeability. Protein 2C: Associates with and induces structural rearrangements of intracellular membranes. It displays RNA-binding, nucleotide binding and NTPase activities (By similarity). Protein 3A, via its hydrophobic domain, serves as membrane anchor. Protease 3C: Cysteine protease that generates mature viral proteins from the precursor polyprotein. In addition to its proteolytic activity, it binds to viral RNA, and thus influences viral genome replication. RNA and substrate bind cooperatively to the protease (By similarity). RNA-directed RNA polymerase 3D-POL replicates genomic and antigenomic RNA by recognizing replications specific signals.
Q6PMW3	2332	Genome polyprotein	?	?	Foot-and-mouth disease virus O	?	Associates with and induces structural rearrangements of intracellular membranes. Triggers host autophagy by interacting with host BECN1 and thereby promotes viral replication. Participates in viral replication and interacts with host DHX9. Displays RNA-binding, nucleotide binding and NTPase activities. May play a role in virion morphogenesis and viral RNA encapsidation by interacting with the capsid protein VP3. Capsid protein V3: Forms an icosahedral capsid of pseudo T=3 symmetry with capsid proteins VP0 and VP3. The capsid is composed of 60 copies of each capsid protein organized in the form of twelve pentamers and encloses the viral positive strand RNA genome. Covalently linked to the 5'-end of both the positive-strand and negative-strand genomic RNAs. Acts as a genome-linked replication primer. Cysteine protease that generates mature viral proteins from the precursor polyprotein. In addition to its proteolytic activity, binds to viral RNA and thus influences viral genome replication. RNA and substrate bind cooperatively to the protease. Mediates self-processing of the polyprotein by a translational effect termed 'ribosome skipping'. Mechanistically, 2A-mediated cleavage occurs between the C-terminal glycine and the proline of the downstream protein 2B. In the case of foot-and-mouth disease virus, the 2A oligopeptide is post-translationally 'trimmed' from the C-terminus of the upstream protein 1D by 3C proteinase. Plays an essential role in the virus replication cycle by acting as a viroporin. Creates a pore in the host reticulum endoplasmic and as a consequence releases Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of infected cell. In turn, high levels of cytoplasmic calcium may trigger membrane trafficking and transport of viral ER-associated proteins to viroplasms, sites of viral genome replication. Plays important roles in virus replication, virulence and host range. RNA-directed RNA polymerase 3D-POL replicates genomic and antigenomic RNA by recognizing replications specific signals. Covalently attaches UMP to a tyrosine of VPg, which is used to prime RNA synthesis. The positive stranded RNA genome is first replicated at virus induced membranous vesicles, creating a dsRNA genomic replication form. This dsRNA is then used as template to synthesize positive stranded RNA genomes. ss(+)RNA genomes are either translated, replicated or encapsidated.

Q801Z4	78	Disintegrin DisBa-01	?	?	Bothrops alternatus	Urutu	This recombinant disintegrin antagonizes integrins alpha-IIb/beta-3 (ITGA2B/ITGB3) and alpha-V/beta-3 (ITGAV/ITGB3). On ITGA2B/ITGB3, it interferes with the outside/-in phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (PTK2 / FAK) downstream of the integrin. It strongly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by ADP, thrombin, and collagen, abolishes and reverses dynamic platelet recruitment to immobilized fibrinogen. In vivo, it induces a dramatic increase in the tail bleeding time, and has a strong antithrombotic activity (PubMed:18508682). On ITGAV/ITGB3, it inhibits the adhesion of ITGAV/ITGB3-expressing human microvascular endothelial cell line and murine melanoma cell line to vitronectin (IC(50) = 555 nM and 225 nM, respectively), and transiently inhibits their proliferation without direct cell toxicity. In vivo, it potently inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis (PubMed:17952617), probably due to its capability to strongly inhibit the expression of VEGF and its receptors in endothelial cells (PubMed:22561350). It also inhibits tumor cell migration in vitro (PubMed:22069567).

Q9Y4K0	774	Lysyl oxidase homolog 2	Lysyl oxidase-like protein 2 / Lysyl oxidase-related protein 2 / Lysyl oxidase-related protein WS9-14	LOXL2	Homo sapiens	Human	Mediates the post-translational oxidative deamination of lysine residues on target proteins leading to the formation of deaminated lysine (allysine) (PubMed:27735137). Acts as a transcription corepressor and specifically mediates deamination of trimethylated 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4me3), a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation (PubMed:27735137). Shows no activity against histone H3 when it is trimethylated on 'Lys-9' (H3K9me3) or 'Lys-27' (H3K27me3) or when 'Lys-4' is monomethylated (H3K4me1) or dimethylated (H3K4me2) (PubMed:27735137). Also mediates deamination of methylated TAF10, a member of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which induces release of TAF10 from promoters, leading to inhibition of TFIID-dependent transcription (PubMed:25959397). LOXL2-mediated deamination of TAF10 results in transcriptional repression of genes required for embryonic stem cell pluripotency including POU5F1/OCT4, NANOG, KLF4 and SOX2 (By similarity). Involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) via interaction with SNAI1 and participates in repression of E-cadherin CDH1, probably by mediating deamination of histone H3 (PubMed:16096638, PubMed:27735137, PubMed:24414204). During EMT, involved with SNAI1 in negatively regulating pericentromeric heterochromatin transcription (PubMed:24239292). SNAI1 recruits LOXL2 to pericentromeric regions to oxidize histone H3 and repress transcription which leads to release of heterochromatin component CBX5/HP1A, enabling chromatin reorganization and acquisition of mesenchymal traits (PubMed:24239292). Interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum protein HSPA5 which activates the IRE1-XBP1 pathway of the unfolded protein response, leading to expression of several transcription factors involved in EMT and subsequent EMT induction (PubMed:28332555). Involved in E-cadherin repression following hypoxia, a hallmark of EMT believed to amplify tumor aggressiveness, suggesting that it may play a role in tumor progression (PubMed:20026874). When secreted into the extracellular matrix, promotes cross-linking of extracellular matrix proteins by mediating oxidative deamination of peptidyl lysine residues in precursors to fibrous collagen and elastin (PubMed:20306300). Acts as a regulator of sprouting angiogenesis, probably via collagen IV scaffolding (PubMed:21835952). Acts as a regulator of chondrocyte differentiation, probably by regulating expression of factors that control chondrocyte differentiation (By similarity).

S0HPF7	1163	Type IV pilus biogenesis factor PilY1	Pilus-associated adhesin PilY	pilY1	Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain PAK)	?	Involved in pilus assembly, twitching motility and adhesion to host cells. Primes type IV pili (T4P) assembly and is required for inclusion of minor pilins PilV, PilW and PilX to the surface pili (By similarity). Stabilizes assembled pilus fibers likely by antagonizing retraction mediated by PilT. Calcium-binding and calcium release by PilY1 seem to be essential for twitching motility and for regulation of pilus retraction dynamics of PilT. Adhesin for human tissue specifically recognizing a host receptor localized or enriched on basolateral epithelial cell surfaces. Binds host integrins in an calcium-dependent manner in vitro and this interaction may be employed by the bacterium to mediate host epithelial cell binding in vivo.
